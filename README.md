# Recursion

These are exercises from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion) to practice recursion.

Exercises:
1. Fibonacci:
   * Use iteration to write a function that takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence.
   * Solve the same problem recursively.
2. Merge Sort: Write a function that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive methodology.

# Set Up

To run these functions from the command line, use the node command installed with nodejs, as described [here](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/blob/aa4239e87a5adc992fdb709c20aebb5f6da77f86/content/learn/command-line/node-run-cli.en.md).
